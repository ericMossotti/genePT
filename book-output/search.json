    "text": "6.1 QC and selecting cells for further analysis\nSeurat allows you to easily explore QC metrics and filter cells based on any user-defined criteria. A few QC metrics commonly used by the community include\n\nThe number of unique genes detected in each cell.\n\nLow-quality cells or empty droplets will often have very few genes\nCell doublets or multiplets may exhibit an aberrantly high gene count\n\nSimilarly, the total number of molecules detected within a cell (correlates strongly with unique genes)\nThe percentage of reads that map to the mitochondrial genome\n\nLow-quality / dying cells often exhibit extensive mitochondrial contamination\nWe calculate mitochondrial QC metrics with the PercentageFeatureSet() function, which calculates the percentage of counts originating from a set of features\nWe use the set of all genes starting with MT- as a set of mitochondrial genes\n\n\n\n# The [[ operator can add columns to object metadata. This is a great place to stash QC stats\npbmc[[\"percent.mt\"]] &lt;- PercentageFeatureSet(pbmc, pattern = \"^MT-\")\n\n\n\nWhere are QC metrics stored in Seurat?\n\n\nThe number of unique genes and total molecules are automatically calculated during CreateSeuratObject()\n\nYou can find them stored in the object meta data\n\n\n# Show QC metrics for the first 5 cells\nhead(pbmc@meta.data, 5)\n\n                 orig.ident nCount_RNA nFeature_RNA percent.mt\nAAACATACAACCAC-1     pbmc3k       2419          779  3.0177759\nAAACATTGAGCTAC-1     pbmc3k       4903         1352  3.7935958\nAAACATTGATCAGC-1     pbmc3k       3147         1129  0.8897363\nAAACCGTGCTTCCG-1     pbmc3k       2639          960  1.7430845\nAAACCGTGTATGCG-1     pbmc3k        980          521  1.2244898\n\n\n\n\n \nIn the example below, we visualize QC metrics, and use these to filter cells.\n\nWe filter cells that have unique feature counts over 2,500 or less than 200\nWe filter cells that have &gt;5% mitochondrial counts\n\n\n#Visualize QC metrics as a violin plot\nVlnPlot(pbmc, features = c(\"nFeature_RNA\", \"nCount_RNA\", \"percent.mt\"), ncol = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# FeatureScatter is typically used to visualize feature-feature relationships, but can be used for anything calculated by the object, i.e. columns in object metadata, PC scores etc.\n\nplot1 &lt;- FeatureScatter(pbmc, \n                        feature1 = \"nCount_RNA\", \n                        feature2 = \"percent.mt\") \n\nplot2 &lt;- FeatureScatter(pbmc, \n                        feature1 = \"nCount_RNA\", \n                        feature2 = \"nFeature_RNA\") \n\nplot1 + plot2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npbmc &lt;- subset(pbmc,\n               subset = nFeature_RNA &gt; 200 \n               & nFeature_RNA &lt; 2500 \n               & percent.mt &lt; 5)",
